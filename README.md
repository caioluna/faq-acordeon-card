### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- During this project I learned more about the **'before'** and **'after'** pseudo-elements and how to use them to stylize the images in the FAQ card.
  ```css
  ::before { } 

  ::after { }
  ```
- Another great feature I learned was developing the show/hide functionality of the accordion using only CSS ```[input=radio]```
  ```html
  <div>
    <input id="item1" type="radio">
    <label for="item1">Label Name</label>
    <div>
        <p>Message</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
